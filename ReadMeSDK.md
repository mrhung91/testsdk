9Chau SKD contain tree major components: Authentication, Payment, Profile Management.

3.1. Authentication: Before playing game, user must pass by SDK authentication.

### [4. Requirements](#header1)
Please make sure development environment and your game meet the following requirements before integrating SDK.

####Development Environment
- For Android development Platform Version 4.0 / API Level 14 is the minimum supported platform.
- You also can use any Android development tool for integrating SDK. But using **Android Studio Tool** (1.2.0 is current version) is the best. 


### [5. Important Notes](#header1)

- Only using exact SDK for each game. If using another SDK, we do not guarantee that data returns correctly.
- Please note that the data accumulated during SDK testing is accumulated as actual measurement data.
- Using authentication function by my 9Chau system.
- Using real Telo card for testing payment function.

### [6. How to integrate SDK](#header1)


#### Import 9chauSDK 
1.	On Android Studio, select File menu -> New -> New Module -> Choose Module Type is Phone and Tablet Application, choose More Modules is Import .JAR or .AAR Package and click Next button -> In File Name input field, click browse button and choose SDK .AAR  file we sent. In Subproject name input field, typing 9chauSDK  and click Finish button.
2.	Update your game app build.grandle by adding dependencies at bottom file:

    ```java
    dependencies {
        compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
        compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:22.1.1'
        compile project(':9chauSDK')
        compile 'com.facebook.android:facebook-android-sdk:4.0.0'
        compile 'com.mcxiaoke.volley:library:1.0.+'
    	compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services:7.5.0'
    }
    ```
####Config project
Add exact this meta-data into your **AndroidManifest.xml**:

    ```
    <meta-data android:name="game_code" android:value="trieu-hoi-3d" />
    ```

####Add new BroadcastReceiver
An Android application cannot have multiple receivers which have the same intent-filtered action. If you want have more than one **INSTALL_REFFERER** receiver, you must make the proxy receiver like this:

- Add this receiver into your AndroidManifest.xml
    
    ```
    <receiver
        android:name="{your_package_name}.tracking.Install"
        android:exported="true" >
        <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="com.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER" />
        </intent-filter>
    </receiver>
    ```
    
- Create package name is **tracking**, then create **Install.java** in this package:
    
    ```
    public class Install extends BroadcastReceiver {
        @Override
        public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
            com.cuuchau.sdk9chau.tracking.InstallationReceiver installationReceiver = new com.cuuchau.sdk9chau.tracking.InstallationReceiver();
            installationReceiver.onReceive(context,intent);

    	// your code here

        }
    }
    ```
