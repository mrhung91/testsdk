### 1. Introduction
This guide is intended to help you integrating SDK for Game. Please read this guide carefully while integrating.

### 2. Terminology
-	A 9Chau account is an account in 9Chau system.
-	A game account, user must register and login before play game.
-	A Telco is telecom company: Viettel, Vinaphone, Mobiphone, â€¦
	- A Telco card contain two code: serial and pin code. User must enter completely and accurately when using payment function.
-	A transaction is a game order when user recharge to a game.
	- A transaction ID is unique order ID for each game order.


### 3. Mind map and Functions

9Chau SKD contain tree major components: Authentication, Payment, Profile Management.


#### 3.1. Authentication: Before playing game, user must pass by SDK authentication.

-	If user want to play game immediately, they can choose **Play now** function. SDK create a random UID for this device, this UID is unique ID on this device. Each device only create one UID and user still use this UID for each other play time.
-	If user has Facebook account, they can choose **Login by Facebook** function. SDK syncs Facebook ID from Facebook App to the game.
-	If user want to use **9Chau account**, they can register and login by 9Chau login function. After that, they must create game account or choose account they created before.


#### 3.2. Payment:
- Telco Card Payment: User must enter completely and accurately serial code and pin code when recharging to game.
- C Payment: C is money unit in 9Chau system, user can use C for recharging to game.
- Google wallet: recharging by google payment service

### 4. Requirements
Please make sure development environment and your game meet the following requirements before integrating SDK.

#### 4.1. Development Environment
- For Android development Platform Version 4.0 / API Level 14 is the minimum supported platform.
- You also can use any Android development tool for integrating SDK. But using **Android Studio Tool** (1.2.0 is current version) is the best. 



    
    
    


### 5. Important Notes

- Only using exact SDK for each game. If using another SDK, we do not guarantee that data returns correctly.
- Please note that the data accumulated during SDK testing is accumulated as actual measurement data.
- Using authentication function by my 9Chau system.
- Using real Telo card for testing payment function.



    
    
    


### 6. How to integrate SDK

#### 6.1. Import 9chauSDK
1.	On **Android Studio**, select **File menu** -> **New** -> **New Module** -> Choose **Module Type is Phone and Tablet Application**, choose **More Modules** is Import .JAR or .AAR Package and click Next button -> In File Name input field, click browse button and choose SDK .AAR  file we sent. In Subproject name input field, typing **9chauSDK** and click Finish button.

2.	Update your game app build.grandle by adding dependencies at bottom file:

```java
    dependencies {
        compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
        compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:22.1.1'
        compile project(':9chauSDK')
        compile 'com.facebook.android:facebook-android-sdk:4.0.0'
        compile 'com.mcxiaoke.volley:library:1.0.+'
    	compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services:7.5.0'
    }
```

#### 6.2. Config project 

Add exact this meta-data into your **AndroidManifest.xml**:

```java
    <meta-data android:name="game_code" android:value="{YOUR_GAME_CODE}" />
```
**Sample code:**

```java
<application android:allowBackup="true" android:icon="@drawable/logo_9chau" android:label="@string/app_name">
	<meta-data android:name="game_code" android:value="{YOUR_GAME_CODE}"/>
```

#### 6.3. Add new BroadcastReceiver 

An Android application cannot have multiple receivers which have the same intent-filtered action. If you want have more than one INSTALL_REFFERER receiver, you must make the proxy receiver like this:

- Remove all INSTALL_REFERRER receiver.
- Add this receiver into your AndroidManifest.xml

    
```java
    <receiver
        android:name="{your_package_name}.tracking.Install"
        android:exported="true" >
        <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="com.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER" />
        </intent-filter>
    </receiver>
```
    
- Create package name is **tracking**, then create **Install.java** in this package:
    
```java
	public class Install extends BroadcastReceiver {
	    @Override
	    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
	        com.cuuchau.sdk9chau.tracking.InstallationReceiver installationReceiver = new com.cuuchau.sdk9chau.tracking.InstallationReceiver();
	        installationReceiver.onReceive(context,intent);
	
	
		// your code here
	    }
	}
```

#### 6.4. Initialize SDK

Add CuuChauSdk.sdk Initialize(this) into onCreate method in your main activity.

**Sample code:**

```java
	@Override
	protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
	// Add this line to your code
	    CuuChauSdk.sdkInitialize(this);
	}
```

#### 6.5. Add authentication function


	To show authentication function, add this script to your main activity, in **onCreate** method

**Sample code:**

```java
    CuuChauSdk.showAuthPanel(new AuthCallback() {
        @Override
        protected void onLoginSuccess(JSONObject user) {
        	//your code here
        }
    
        @Override
        protected void onRegisterSuccess(JSONObject user) {
    	    //your code here
        }
    
        @Override
        protected void onLogout() {
        	//your code here
        }
    });
```


##### Methods of AuthCallback:

| Methods | Parameters | Description  |
|:--------|:---------|:-----|
| onLoginSuccess      | JSONObject | Called after user login successfully |
| onRegisterSuccess      | JSONObject      |   Called after user create new game account |
| onLogout |       |  Called when user sign out   |



##### User Properties:
|Properties | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
|status|String|**status** = 1 (successful), otherwise is not successful|
|message| String | describes **status** in detail |
|username| String |must match with **username** 9chau server provides|
|game_code| String |must match **game_code** 9chau server provides|
|token|	String |must match **token** 9chau server provides|
|error_code| String	| must match **error_code** game server provides|
|session_key| String | must match **session_key** game server provides|

If you want to get username property, you can access to **user** object by use this script: user.getString("username");


#### 6.6. Add payment function


To show payment function, add this script to payment button click event:

```java
    CuuChauSdk.showRechargePanel(gameOrder, new PaymentCallback() {
        @Override
        public void onSuccess() {
	        // your code here
        }
    });
```

*Note: type of gameOrder parameter is json string.*

**Sample code:**

```java
    @Override
    public void onClick(View v) {
        if(v.getId()== R.id.btnCharge){
            CuuChauSdk.showRechargePanel(gameOrder, new PaymentCallback() {
                @Override
                public void onSuccess() {
    		        // your code here
                }
            });
        }
    }
```

##### PaymentCallback Methods:

|Methods|Parameters|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|onSuccess| |Called after recharging success|


#### 6.7. Add profile function

To show profile, please add this script to profile button: CuuChauSdk.showProfilePanel();

**Sample code:**

```java
    @Override
    public void onClick(View v) {
        if(v.getId()== R.id.btnProfile){
            CuuChauSdk.showProfilePanel();
        }
    }
```
